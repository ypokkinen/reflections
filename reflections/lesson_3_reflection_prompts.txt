When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to work with a team or want to share my code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When I pull changes manually, I am sure that i have made all changes needed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Fork is a GitHub-to-Github operation; nothing is copied to your PC. Clone copies Github repository to your PC.
Branch is for example a version of the project.
    

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
As you make changes to the project you can compare your commits with the remote state and this can help merge branches with a contributor

    

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
Without proper version control, there is a need to be many files inside a project for each version. 
Also, collaboration would be much more difficult as it would need to send multiple files back and forth.
Without github though, there would be no need to commit changes which would take time and effort to the programmer.
    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

To test out a new feature that might interfere with the master branch. Also, working on seperate branches helps collaraborators working on a project and reduces the confusion and the amount of inconvenience between team memebers.
The other approach, which is making all the changes on the master branch is easier to commit and there is less work needed to merge new changes.
