What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Transform the current directory into a Git repository. This adds a .git folder to the current directory and makes it possible to start recording revisions of the project.

How is the staging area different from working directory and the repository? What values do you think it offers?
Staging area is basically a loading dock where you get to determine what changes get shipped away.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add only files that are logically dependant to each other.
